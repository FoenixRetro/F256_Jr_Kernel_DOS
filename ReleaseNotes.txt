The 1/16/2023 release adds the following features:
    - Fat32 SD Card support
    - IEC sub-directory support
    - DOS drive select commands (eg 'A:<enter>')
    - DOS drive prefix paths (eg 'read c:foo.txt')
    - Further improvements to speed startup.
    
THINGS TO NOTE!!!!

    - You MUST upgrade the FPGA core for the SD Card to work.
    
    - The SD Card on the Rev A is not yet supported.

    - The kernel is 40kB -- FIVE flash slots!  FAT32 support is
      spread over two slots alone, although there is some empty space.

    - The kernel is only probing the SD Card once, at startup;
      for now, you will need to reboot when you swap cards.
      Removing and re-inserting the same card without a reboot
      will not work!

    - The SPI layer is presently only supporting the latest
      Rev B board flash (Jan 14th and beyond).  The current
      Rev A board and flash may be supported in the future.

    - The SPI layer is presently only supporting V2 SD Cards
      (these are modern HC and XC cards).  Older V1 cards
      won't work (this is primarily a software limitation).

    - SPI fast-mode is currently not working, but slow-mode 
      is still 100x faster than IEC :).

    - The FAT layer won't handle off-the-shelf format parameters;
      you will need to format the card from the Foenix to ensure
      compatibility.

    - SD Card LED control isn't wired in yet.
